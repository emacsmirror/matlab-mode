# matlab-ts-bin/README.org

Builds of https://github.com/acristoffers/tree-sitter-matlab

We use the following subdirectory naming convention:

: ./YYYYMMDD-SHA1/ARCH/

where =YYYYMMDD= corresponds to the year, month, day of the
https://github.com/acristoffers/tree-sitter-matlab commit =SHA1= and
ARCH is from the MATLAB command, =computer('arch')=.

We are using this convention instead of the tree-sitter-matlab release number
to make things more flexible.  This convention lets us deploy based on commits
rather than release numbers.
